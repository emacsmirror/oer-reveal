# To display images with license information, two macros are
# available.  First, revealimg() expects up to three arguments, a
# filename for a file with meta-data about an image, a caption
# (optional), and (optionally) the maximum height of image in HTML,
# e.g., 50vh.  This is meant to be used with horizontally centered
# images, caption underneath, license text rotated to the right.
# Second, reveallicense() expects up to two arguments, the filename
# for meta-data and optionally the maximum height.  Here, the image is
# displayed inline in the surrouding paragraph or list, aligned to the
# right.  Again, license information is rotated to the right of the
# image.
# The macros use function reveal-export-attribution, defined in
# reveal-config.el.
#
# See emacs-reveal-howto for sample use:
