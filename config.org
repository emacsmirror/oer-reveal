# To display images with license information, two macros are available.
# First, revealimg() expects two arguments, a filename for a file with
# meta-data about an image and a caption.  This is meant to be used
# with horizontally centered images, caption underneath, license text
# rotated to the right.
# Second, reveallicense() expects just one argument, the filename for
# meta-data.  Here, the image is displayed inline in the surrouding
# paragraph or list, aligned to the right.  Again, license information
# is rotated to the right of the image.
# See emacs-reveal-howto for sample use:
